# DotNetGadgeteerCam
This is the code I originally wrote in 2012 for a [.NET Gadgeeter-based][1] camera module to mount on my Roomba. See my [original blog post][3] and [a later update][4] for more details.

I haven't updated this code in a while, so it probably needs some work to function with the latest version of the .NET Microframework and Gadgeteer components.
